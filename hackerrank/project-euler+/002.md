## Project Euler #2: Even Fibonacci numbers

### Problem Statement

This problem is a programming version of [Problem 2](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2) from [projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net/).

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

    1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,⋯

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed ***N***, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

### Input Format

First line contains ***T*** that denotes the number of test cases. This is followed by ***T*** lines, each containing an integer, ***N***.

### Output Format

Print the required answer for each test case.

### Constraints

* 1 ≤ ***T*** ≤ 10<sup>5</sup>
* 10 ≤ ***N*** ≤ 4×10<sup>16</sup>

### Sample Input

    2
    10
    100

### Sample Output

    10
    44
